This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).The backend was built using Node.js and Express.js combined with a MongoDB database.

This application is an online marketplace for clothing designers. Designers can post sketches or pictures of clothing articles they have designed. Other users can upvote the clothing article. If a clothing design gets enough upvotes, the designer can actually have the product manufactured. The purpose of this site is to allow designers to get user feedback before committing time and money to manufacturing their new clothing article.
