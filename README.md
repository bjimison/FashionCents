This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The front end was built with React.js, while the backend was built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

This application is an online marketplace for clothing designers. Designers can post sketches or pictures of clothing articles they have designed. Other users can upvote the clothing article if they would potentially purchase that article. If a clothing design gets enough upvotes, the designer can actually have the product manufactured knowing their product has a good chance of being purchased. The purpose of this site is to allow designers to get user feedback before committing time and money to manufacturing their new clothing article.

Thank you to my teachers Isha Arora and Kenny Bushman for helping me through this project.
